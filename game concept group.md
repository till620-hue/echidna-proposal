Game concept 

The game name is Echidna                                                                                                        The game about snakes kinda like the snake game that eats the apples 

Platformer | fixed screen | dashing | boss fights | pixel art | speed/ reflexes

  The game will fit all these genres with the way that the snake will have to move to look for food and that being apples, most of the time they will be popping up randomly and as that happens the screen will all be fixed but animals and enemies can come towards the snake. The main setting of this game will all just be a snake that went to go get food.

 The place will be three different types of ecosystems where snakes find themselves. Each of them will be about snakes fighting for territory against others since they either are in groups or alone but in two of the levels it will also be about how much food you eat because food is very hard to find in some places. The three places that will be involved within the game will be forest desert and meadow. This does not have much of a backstory except the fact that it is about snakes within their ecosystem. Each of these will have a boss fight at the very end and it will be an animal natural predator of that ecosystem. The type of snake that will be for every level can me customized deepening the player

There is nothing much for the snake to have a backstory unless we make a backstory mode for it but nothing much. The snake is on its way to get food and to fight for territory. The back story will either be from. Some of the enemies will either be obstacles or they will be the boss fight. The majority of the game will have not much of a story line and more of survival and fighting.

Echidna the snake, it is an echidna snake and what keeps the snake moving is eating apples.

Antagonists (the villains, enemies, or obstacles): Who or what is working against them?

Typhon is a different species of snake that rivals the echidna snake.

Different species of snakes that are rivals

Like normal with a snake skin

All age game that will be free for everyone

 It is simple and could be for when they just feel bored

To get more skins along with the chane to change what the enemy looks like will be the main focus that I want players to continue playing for.

What makes the game stand out would have to be how it is simple yet the fact that it can also have different modes if we wanted too.

inspirations:

The snake game- the difficulty is not that hard and it makes it a simple game by just having to press four keys and eat the apples without touching the rest of the body 

pac man- the idea of having more enemies and having to collect everything until you move to the next level.

 The game will not be complete if it does not have the snake game that was the whole inspiration for this.

I hope to have the players to feel a bit of excitement just playing the game and winning.  
And I strongly believe that The game itself and probably the rewards that they can get when they win a round.
